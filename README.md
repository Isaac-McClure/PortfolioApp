# PortfolioApp
An app to collect and display other projects.

I built it using React, .Net and Mongo. It is the first time I have used either React or Mongo, so creating it has been a great way for me to learn to use these technologies in a basic app. It has a home page to show the projects, a detail page like the one you're viewing now, and an admin portal for CRUD operations.

It is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. Terraform is used to create the AWS resources.
Cloudflare is configured for protection.
It uses Cloudinary as a CDN to deliver the images.
The server only accepts requests over https.


Based on the visual studio react dot net template.
